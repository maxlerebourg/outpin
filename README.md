# OutPin

OutPin is a history of all your trips deployable as a Go program thanks to [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io).  
OutPin offers a way to plan your future holidays by creating adventures and adding steps to them.


## Installation

Run the Docker image provided `ghcr.io/maxlerebourg/outpin`.

The default port is 8090, but it can be overridden using the Docker CMD argument with `--http=http://0.0.0.0:9999`

All data is stored in the `/pb/pb_data` folder.

Don’t forget to use PocketBase’s built-in backup system or implement your own backup solution.

The search and the pin placement can be down if some individuals use all my free quotas from [Nominatim](https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org).

The map from [Carto](https://carto.com) can be impossible to display for the same reason.

### About

I wanted to create a Go alternative to [AdventureLog](https://adventurelog.app) because I dislike Python for no particular reason and I needed a goal to use [PocketBase](https://pocketbase.io).  
At first, I wanted to use the same interface/API as AdventureLog, but as my needs evolved, I decided to take a different approach.  
As a traveler, I find it hard to remember all the trips I’ve taken, so I created an app to help me keep track of them.
